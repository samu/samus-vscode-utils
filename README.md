# cursor-placement

A VSCode extension which helps with cursor placement:

- if the cursor is in the currently visible range, the editor will scroll so
  that the cursor is close to the top of the screen (5 lines under the top of
  the editor window)

- if the cursor is not in the currently visible range, the cursor will be brought
  into the center of that range
